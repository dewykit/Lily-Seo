		The bipolar house of cluster and noncluster, with modes of concealment and reveal the house on a high level, attempts to erase all evidence of the living. ‘Forensic in the Tube’ forces users to closely inspect the hidden details of the house for the house to slowly unravel itself. There is a sense of needing time, or inspecting in close proximity - almost like a first date with the house to get to know each other… or an investigation in a motion of reevaluating of what is invisible. Hence the name ‘Forensic in the Tube’. Over time, for a user of the house, or as a guest to the owner, the relationship a user has will determine greatly to how much the house will allow the user to explore the house similar to filtering out in a house of linearity.

	<br>

	<p>As an open floor plan, there are no physical boundaries separating the programs. The house offers two definite served and servant spaces to assist in creating programs and rituals that support the living. The servant spaces - toilets, storage, technical rooms, duct shaft and kitchen uses the momentum created by a single levelled line across the span of the house to protect the services and to encapsulate. The servant areas meant for inhibition allows for all the material, object and occupancy. </p>

	<p>PROGRAMS DIAGRAM</p>
	<img src="images/program-diagram-gif.gif" class="img-responsive" alt="Programs diagram">	
	<br>
	<br>
	<p>Served and servant diagrams are drawn in 3 levels in relation to the scale of a user. At bird eye level shows the roof plan of the house. Demonstrating the slope and therefore the methodology of water management. At the eye level, the plan sliced the house revealing the servant areas of the house. This diagram exposes the hidden systems, services such as kitchen, storage, wet area (toilet, shower, kitchen, basin…). At the lowest level - at hand-reach level, shows the served areas. Demonstrating the expansion of the living to the blank canvas extruded along-side the joinery. Sleeping areas are made, dining areas can be expanded to accommodate upto 5 people. The balcony at the end of the working space can be used to dry laundry or to have a cup of tea depending on the flexible furniture set-ups.

	<p>TIME DIAGRAM</p>
	<img src="images/program-diagram-2.gif" class="img-responsive" alt="Time diagram">
	<p>	Reacting to the water management system (the roof) as discussed earlier, spits rainwater surrounding the house. This allows growth for greenery and almost as an activation or invitation for “a wildlife jungle” or an “ecosystem” to develop alongside the house and the client of the house. 

The diagrams show house and the greenery at a few milestones - at 1 year, 5 years, 10 years, 20 years and at 50 years after use, when it is anticipated to complete the triangular geometry. As a symbolism of celebration of life and the many repeated daily cycles and or journeys encapsulated in the house. In aim to allow co-existing between human and fauna with cautious choices of non-toxic materials toward a carbon neutral project in the long run.

	<p>SOLAR DIAGRAM</p>

	<p>Solar access of the house, responding to the time, has dual duties as:
</p>
<br>
<p>1. Biological clock</p><br>
<p>2. Guide of circulation</p>
<br>
<br>
<p> Light from the East is introduced to both sleeping areas at 9am. Harsh sunlight is shaded during midday in the living spaces to protect users from direct sunlight. West afternoon sunlight comes through during the afternoon at all times of the year, advocating for the use of the dining and shared area.

	<br>
<p>Similarly, the bipolar-ness of the house is illustrated in both sections and interior perspective comparing both modes of living, in-relation to time, use and program. Maximising on the differences in level of “cluster”, drawing the rituals. Interior fittings are custom to fit in the 600mm joinery. The joinery is carved, fitted with slide openings with both vertical horizontal to expose surfaces of servants. With the exception of the toilet area, with an opening which releases the consistent tension of the geometry in that one particular space of the house.
</p>

<br>

<p>Given the brief of 155m2 area, the linearity of the house creates a thin long tube of spaces. There are two bends which make the nooks and crevices of spaces with varying levels of privacy. Due to the nature of the house, the plan, elevation and section almost look different sizes. In the plan, the house creates a large negative space - seemingly large, the section shows the long continuation and the interior elevation shows the immediate scale of living.

<p> The structure of the house is fine, held up with thin steel rods with tension. With a bridge-like structure, a lightweight steel frame supports the house. With weathering, the wooden battens bare wind and rain resulting in the steel tarnishes red with spots of green peeling off. </p>
